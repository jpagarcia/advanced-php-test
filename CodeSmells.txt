! Code smells:

- The file structure could've been organized better
? how
- Export file is messy. should be more organized into classes
    - should only contain the instantiation of the controller and the export call
- the sequence of the code should be easy to read
    - e.g. requiring initial files should be on top
- unused import in export.php
    - Illuminate/Support
    - include('include/utils.php');
    - require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
- the processing of the $_REQUEST should be done within the controller
